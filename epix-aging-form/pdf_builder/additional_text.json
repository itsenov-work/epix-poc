    "neutral": "Biological/inner age assessment results indicate a notably positive and well-rounded approach to ageing based on the responses provided in the questionnaire.\n\nRegular engagement in moderate to high-intensity physical activities such as walking, cycling, and strength training, coupled with a diverse and balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, contribute to robust cardiovascular health and overall vitality. The absence of smoking, limited alcohol consumption, and adherence to recommended sleep durations further underscore a commitment to optimal well-being. A clean medical history, lack of chronic conditions, and a family history devoid of age-related diseases align with a genetic predisposition for a healthy ageing trajectory. Stress management practices, including mindfulness and meditation, demonstrate a proactive stance towards mental health. These positive lifestyle choices collectively yield a NORMAL biological/inner age assessment indicative of well-maintained physical, mental, and emotional health, aligning closely with the chronological age and reflecting a normal and healthy ageing state.",
    "bad": "Biological/inner age assessment results reveal indicators consistent with accelerated ageing based on responses in the questionnaire.\n\nLimited engagement in physical activities and sedentary or low exercise levels may contribute to a decline in cardiovascular health and overall physical resilience. Unhealthy dietary habits, such as the rare consumption of fruits and vegetables, suggest potential gaps in essential nutrients crucial for ageing well. Smoking and heavy alcohol consumption can accelerate the ageing process, impacting respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Chronic medical conditions, medication use, and a family history of age-related diseases may contribute to an increased risk of health challenges associated with accelerated ageing. Elevated stress levels and a lack of stress-reducing practices further indicate potential impacts on mental health. These combined factors collectively suggest an ACCELERATED BIOLOGICAL/INNER AGE, emphasizing the importance of adopting healthier lifestyle choices to mitigate the risk and promote a more optimal ageing trajectory.",
    "good": "Biological/inner age assessment results unveil a profile indicative of delayed ageing, reflecting a biological age younger than the chronological age.\n\nRegular participation in moderate to high-intensity physical activities such as walking, running, strength training, and a diverse and balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables contribute significantly to cardiovascular health and overall resilience. The absence of smoking, limited alcohol consumption, and consistent adherence to recommended sleep durations showcase a commitment to optimal well-being. A clean medical history, a lack of chronic conditions, and a family history devoid of age-related diseases align with a genetic predisposition for a healthily prolonged lifespan. Stress management practices, including mindfulness and meditation, underscore a proactive approach to mental health, contributing to the overall YOUNGER/DELAYED BIOLOGICAL AGE. These positive lifestyle choices collectively depict a biological/inner age assessment indicative of well-maintained physical, mental, and emotional health, portraying a state of delayed ageing and a younger biological age compared to the chronological age."
